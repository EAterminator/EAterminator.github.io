I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interests include Machine Learning and applications in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Quanying Liu](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=UpP9hJ8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am currently working in Neural Compute and Control(NCC) Lab from at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology.
