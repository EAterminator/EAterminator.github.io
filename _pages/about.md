I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interests include Machine Learning and applications in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience.

In SUSTech, I work in [Neural Compute and Control(NCC) Lab](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?cat=2&tagid=liuqy&orderby=date&iscss=1&snapid=1&go=2) at the Department of Biomedical Engineering wuth  [Prof. Quanying Liu](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=UpP9hJ8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am currently an intern at [LABS](https://labs-laboratory.com/) in Columbia Univeristy, working with (Prof. Junhao Wen)[https://www.columbiaradiology.org/profile/junhao-hao-wen-phd] on modeling disease heterogeneity.
